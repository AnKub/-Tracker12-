# 💰 Expense Tracker - Because Money Doesn't Track Itself! 

Hey there, fellow human who also struggles with money management! 👋

This is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** expense tracker that will (hopefully) help you figure out where all your money goes. Spoiler alert: it's probably coffee and random Amazon purchases. ☕🛒

## 🚀 What's This All About?

We're building a fancy expense tracker that lets you:
- ✅ Track income and expenses (revolutionary, I know)
- ✅ See pretty charts of your financial chaos
- ✅ Feel guilty about that impulse purchase last week
- ✅ Switch between light/dark themes (because aesthetics > actual budgeting)

## 🛠️ Current Development Status



**What works:**
- Dashboard with stats that make you cry
- Dark/light theme toggle (priorities!)
- User authentication (fake, but it's something)
- Beautiful SCSS styling that took way too long
- TypeScript everywhere because we're not animals

**What's next:**
- Modal for the TransactionForm (pop-ups make everything better)
- Charts that visualize your poor life choices
- Export to CSV (so you can share your financial disasters)

## 🤓 Tech Stack (AKA The Usual Suspects)

- **React 19** - Because hooks are life
- **TypeScript** - For when you want to argue with your code
- **Vite** - Fast like your money disappearing
- **SCSS** - CSS but with superpowers
- **Zustand** - State management that doesn't make you cry
- **localStorage** - The poor man's database

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (Get This Thing Running)

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install dependencies (prepare for npm magic)
npm install

# Start the dev server (cross your fingers)
npm run dev

# Marvel at your creation on http://localhost:5174
```

## 🎭 Features That Actually Work

- **Responsive Design**: Works on your phone, tablet, and that ancient laptop
- **Theme Switching**: Because your eyes deserve options
- **Form Validation**: Won't let you add negative money (sadly realistic)
- **Real-time Updates**: See your balance drop in real-time!

## 🔧 For Fellow Developers

Built with modern React patterns:
- Functional components everywhere
- Custom hooks for theme management
- Zustand for global state (Redux who?)
- SCSS modules because CSS-in-JS is still scary
- TypeScript interfaces that actually make sense

## 🐛 Known Issues

- No actual bank integration (feature, not bug)
- Can't automatically add money to your account (working on it)
- May cause existential crisis when viewing spending habits
